## WORK EXPERIENCE

### Toga Networks, A Huawei Company – Hod HaSharon
**Senior Data Scientist, Cloud Security & AI Team (2018 – 2022)**

- **Cryptomining Detection Project (2021 – 2022):**
  - Devised and implemented a tailored detector for the Stratrum mining protocol to identify cryptomining activities.
  - Analyzed message length distributions and timing patterns to distinguish legitimate communications from mining-related behavior.
  - Leveraged heuristic methods and machine learning techniques to enhance detection accuracy, achieving high detection rates and significantly contributing to proactive network security.

- **Linux Behavior-Based Anti-Ransomware Protection (2020 – 2021):**
  - Researched and implemented multiple features for effective ransomware activity detection.
  - Developed a system-wide Linux eBPF/bpftrace-based tracing tool for comprehensive data collection.
  - Created a lab environment featuring synthetic ransomware and filesystem generators; later guided the design of a versatile ransomware simulation tool for robust model evaluation.
  - Built an end-to-end proof-of-concept (POC) agent demonstrating ransomware detection with minimal false positives.

- **Application Layer Anti-DDoS Protection (2019 – 2020):**
  - Developed a model to classify HTTP traffic as benign or malicious under noisy conditions with constrained feature selection.
  - Engineered a process to generate enforceable signatures for the WAF engine using association rule mining algorithms; implemented several algorithms in Java (one in production).
  - Designed and implemented a behavior-based botnet detection algorithm using a customized DBSCAN-like clustering method.
  - Contributed to the team’s receipt of the Team Gold Medal Award, Huawei’s highest internal honor.

- **Web-Application Firewall Initiatives (2018):**
  - Developed multiple proof-of-concepts (POCs) by replacing traditional rule-based web attack detection with anomaly detection techniques.
  - Explored both seq2seq LSTM-based autoencoders and traditional N-grams-based approaches to enhance detection accuracy.

### AI Applied Research Team
**Research Engineer (2022 – Present)**

- **Distributed Training Optimization – “Adaptive Consensus Gradients Aggregation for Scaled Distributed Training” ("Adacons" Project) (2022):**
  - Contributed to the research and development of the paper *"Adaptive Consensus Gradients Aggregation for Scaled Distributed Training."*
  - Developed and implemented an adaptive gradient aggregation method designed to replace the traditional AllReduce operation in Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) training.
  - Employed an adaptive consensus strategy that dynamically aggregates differential gradients, reducing communication overhead while ensuring robust convergence on large-scale tasks.
  - Efficiently coded the solution in PyTorch and validated it on diverse tasks, including NLP (BERT, GPT), computer vision (ImageNet, SSD), and recommendation systems.
  - Automated extensive experiments on local servers to streamline evaluation and hyperparameter tuning.

- **Internal Network Devices Chatbot (2023 – Present):**
  - Led the development of a chatbot capable of answering queries using an internal database of network device manuals (e.g., routers).
  - Fine-tuned a large language model (LLM) on domain-specific documentation to ensure context-aware, accurate responses.
  - Designed robust data ingestion and preprocessing pipelines for document preparation.
  - Implemented comprehensive evaluation protocols (accuracy, F1 score, user feedback) to continuously monitor and enhance performance.
  - Collaborated with cross-functional teams to refine model behavior and meet operational requirements.
