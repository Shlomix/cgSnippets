# DSH Setup and Usage Guide

## Introduction
This guide provides detailed instructions for setting up and running Distributed Shell (DSH) on a cluster of machines. Specifically, it covers the configuration of DSH on four Linux/Unix machines, named g111, g112, g113, and g114, including the process of creating and distributing SSH keys for secure operation.

## Prerequisites
- Four machines (g111, g112, g113, g114) running Linux/Unix
- Sudo or root access on all machines
- Basic knowledge of Linux/Unix commands

## Installing DSH
Execute the following commands on each machine:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install dsh

## Generating SSH Keys
### 4.1. Generate SSH Key
On your primary machine (e.g., g111):
ssh-keygen -t rsa
Follow the prompts to complete the key generation.

### 4.2. Copy Public Key to Other Machines
Copy the public key to the other machines in the network:
ssh-copy-id username@g112
ssh-copy-id username@g113
ssh-copy-id username@g114
Replace `username` with the actual user name on each machine.

## Configuring DSH
### 5.1. Create a Machine List File
Create a file listing all the machines:
nano ~/machines.list
Add the following machine names:
g111
g112
g113
g114

### 5.2. Configure DSH
Edit DSH configuration:
nano ~/.dsh/machines.list
Add the following line:
include ~/machines.list

## Testing DSH
Test your DSH setup:
dsh -a date
You should see the current date and time from each machine if the setup is correct.

## Troubleshooting
- Check SSH key permissions (600 for private keys)
- Ensure SSH service is running on all machines
- Verify firewall settings to allow SSH traffic

## Conclusion
With this setup, you can now execute commands across your network of machines using DSH, simplifying the management of multiple systems.
